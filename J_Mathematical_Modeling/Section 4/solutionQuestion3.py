print("Looking at the steady states equations, even though all the quantities (mRNA production rate, number of polymerase complexes in each stage of the process) depend on the ratio k_p/k_q, in all the expressions this ratio is convolved by many other parameters. The only exception is the ratio of the polymerases in the paused state, to the polymerases in the elongating state. Indeed, this ratio k_p/k_q is exactly Pp/Pe: we should therefore design an experiment that is able to compute this ratio. ")
print("Technically, this can be achieved using Global  RUn On Sequencing data (GRO-seq)")
print("But still, we would access k_p/k_q and not both rates individually, which would remain non-identifiable. To access to both rates separately, we should measure the full kinetics in such an experiment and not only the steady state. If k_p and k_q are faster than the limit time resolution of our measurement device, this might not be achievable.")
