print("No, because if all polymerase complexes are tagged with a fluorophore then irrespective of the stage of the process in which they are, they will give the same signal in principle. Hence the signal we will measure is the total number of polymerase complexes, P_tot, and in this model P_tot is a constant, independent of any model parameter k_i, at any instant of time: hence, dP_tot/dk_i=0 for all parameters k_i and they are all non-identifiable.
