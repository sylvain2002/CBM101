print("A rapid Google search reveals that unlike the mammalian cells we just discussed, bacteria also follow chemo-attractants, but move thanks to a flagella. The flagellar motion is driven by a flagellar “molecular motor” that can move clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW). Only when the CCW motor rotation propels the bacteria, straight, otherwise it tumbles. Rotation CW or CCW is regulated by a biochemical pathway that responds to chemo-attractants (via surface receptors, signal integration, and downstream signaling to motor proteins). In addition, bacteria are not (barely) deformable. So a first modeling strategy could be: 1) model the (short-term) time evolution of the biochemical pathway, using initial chemo-attractants gradients as an input and arranging so that the CW or CCW rotation are a definite model output; and 2) simulate the subsequent bacterial motion (i.e. straight motion vs tumbling), update the profile of chemo-attractants, then the biochemical response, then update motion… And compare such simulations to experimental data. But because bacteria are barely deformable, and that no cell deformation is involved in the actual motion, the boundaries when solving the biochemical network model would be fixed.")
