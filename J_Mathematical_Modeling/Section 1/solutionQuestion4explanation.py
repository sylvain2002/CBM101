print("Because we want to compute the ratio of internal to external glucose, both need to be part of the model. Glucose is imported with the help of Hxt proteins. Rgt2 and Snf3 are both redundantly inhibiting Mth1 and Std1, which are also redundant in activating Rgt1, resulting in HXT genes repression. Again, the linear pathway that connects the Rgt2/Snf3 pair to HXT genes expression can be condensed to 2 nodes connected with an activation edge: Snf3/Rgt2 overall activates the HXT genes. In this context, RGT2 deletion can be modeled by a decreased signaling of the Rgt2/Snf3 pair to the HXT genes, hence by a change in model parametrization, not structure. On the other side, similarly, internal glucose overall inhibits SNF3(and other genes, but which are not required for our question, so ignored). All in all we end up with the simplified model structure displayed above. Conceptually, this models preserves the possibility to explore the internal glucose -> SNF3 repression edge, which is currently not understood, by adding new putative model objects acting on this edge (question mark).")
