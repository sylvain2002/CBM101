Of course, to get biological insight at some point we'll get to write explicitly that this variable depends on both space and time though z=xi-c*tau. But to solve the mathematical equations, we don't need to, rather we keep things as simple as possible. The equation is a second order ODE. We have seen that one convenient way to tackle such equations was to express it as a system of 2 coupled first order ODEs, where one variable is the unknown function Phi and the second one, its derivative:")

We note that the biologically acceptable values of Phi are such that 0<=Phi(z)<=1, because those biological variables are positive and the carrying capacity (maximal population) of the renormalized Logistic PDE is 1. Hence, the phase portrait shall be plotted for 0=<Phi<=1, the values of Psi being a priori unrestricted.")
