print("Then, because all microtubules have potentially different lengths, we sort them into length bins, such as we did for size bins in a population of cells. Hence, we rather describe the density of microtubules which have a total length between x and x+dx, u(t,x).")
print("We are making progress. However, would such a u(t,x)-based model be sufficient to describe the hydrolysis of GTP into GDP along the microtubule, and hence the possibility of a GDP-bound (+) end which is at the origin of the microtubule catastrophe? Certainly not, because the density u(t,x) would not differentiate GTP-bound from GDP-bound tubulin units along the filament. Thus, we have to add a separate variable that represent the length of the GDP-bound tubulin domain (black on the figure): we will use a density u that depends on both the total length x, and the length of the GDP-bound domain y:")
