If kA->B was different from kB->A, the matrix A wouldn't have one of the particular forms with which the calculation of the exponential is straightforward. So we would have needed to diagonalize the matrix using a transformation P such that D=P^-1*A*P is diagonal, compute the exponential of the diagonal matrix, and invert the transformation to get exp(A). This procedure would have mixed the oscillatory functions, generating damped or amplified oscillations depending on the choice of parameters. A good exercise to do!")
