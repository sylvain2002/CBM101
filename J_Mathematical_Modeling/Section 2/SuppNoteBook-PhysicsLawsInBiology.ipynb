    "# Physics laws commonly used in mathematical modeling of biological systems \n",
    "This notebook lists physics laws which are commonly used in modeling biological systems. It is intended for biology students who want to have an idea of the content and meaning of physical laws relevant to their systems, in order to improve their communication skills with quantitative scientists in collaborative modeling projects. It describes the laws, the meaning of the variables and parameters, the range of applicability and the biological context(s) in which the laws are useful/used, and the conservation laws it is generally associated with. When possible, simplified versions of the law and/or partially solved problems that are very common in biology will be presented. This is a \"forever-work-in-progress\" notebook, that will be enriched by your suggestions!\n",

    "## 1. Fick's law(s) of diffusion \n",
    "Many biomolecular systems of interest in biomedicine are inhomogeneous, and experiments measure spatial gradients of molecule concentration, activity, or interactions... etc. When inhomogeneity arises in a continuous system, there is a universal \"force\" that tends to drive the system back to homogeneity over time. This trend is quantified by the Fick's law: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{J} = -D * \\vec\\nabla{C}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This law represents the flux vector $\\vec{J}$ of a molecule in a solution, that is generated by the existence of a spatial gradient $\\vec\\nabla{C}$ in the concentration $C$ of the molecule. In this law, the concentration flux is quantified per unit time, and across a unit surface orthogonal to the gradient. $D$ is the diffusion coefficient (always positive), it has the units (in physics, we call this \"dimension\") of a surface per unit time, and depends on the type of molecule, the existence or not of a physical barrier orthogonal to the gradient (e.g. porous membrane...), temperature... etc. This first Fick's law expresses the fact that a flux is generated by a concentration gradient. It is a consequence of a much more general law of Nature: systems tend to become homogeneous over time. Hence, try to have Fick's law in mind everytime you know there is some inhomogeneity in any feature of the system you model: there will be a flux, along the feature gradient, from regions where the feature is \"high\" to regions where it is \"low\". \n",
    "\n",
    "The equation for the flux is often coupled to a balance equation for the concentration C(x,y,z,t) of molecule (or more generally the inhomogenous feature) that depends on time and the 3 space coordinates x, y, z: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\vec\\nabla . \\vec J = R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $R$ is the net rate of molecule production (production - destruction/conversion to something else) at this particular location of the system. The term $ \\vec\\nabla . \\vec J = \\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial J_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial J_z}{\\partial z}$ (where x, y z are the 3 directions of space and $J_x,y,z$ the components of the flux vector along these directions) is called the <b> divergence </b> of the flux vector $\\vec J$ and expresses the balance of inward and outward molecule fluxes at the particular location where you are looking at (local) concentration changes. Indeed, in a continuous system, the flux vector might be different at different positions in space because spatial gradients might <b> themselves </b> be inhomogenous. The total net amount of molecules transported per unit time at your particular location is the difference between the outward flux at our location and the inward flux from <b> neighbor locations </b>. Hence, when computing this net flux, the derivatives of the flux vector $\\vec J$ components along the three directions of space naturally appear when writing the \"spatial balance equation\". \n",
    "\n",
    "But long story short: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\vec\\nabla . \\vec J = \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} + \\frac{\\partial J_x}{\\partial x} + \\frac{\\partial J_y}{\\partial y} + \\frac{\\partial J_z}{\\partial z} =R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "is a fundamental \"conservation equation\" that expresses the fact that, locally, within a short amount of time $dt$ there is no other changes in the local amount of molecules than the net production rate $R$: molecules are not instantaneously transported to or from distant places in the system. <b> This local conservation equation shall be written for any space-dependent model </b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "An immediate consequence is that, when plugging the first Fick's law in this conservation equation (and assuming the diffusion coefficient $D$ is homogeneous in space, one obtains the <b> diffusion equation </b>: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial t} = D* \\Delta C + R = D*(\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial z^2}) + R$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can remark here that this balance equation for the concentration $C$ is very similar to the ODEs developed in the notebook Section 2 - Animating the structure, with the addition of one extra term: the diffusion term $D*(\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial x^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial y^2}+\\frac{\\partial^2 C}{\\partial z^2})$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Fick's law(s) shall be used in modeling any interacting biomolecular systems (in the continuum approximation) that is not homogeneous in space, so typically with existing gradients of molecules concentrations or activity within a given organelle. It can also be used to model the passive transfer of biomolecules through porous membranes (such as blood vessels) due to concentration gradients, osmotic fluxes ... any situation where an inhomogenous system has the potential to become homogenous over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Solid dynamics and the Newton equations\n",
    "Many fields of biomedicine require the description/modeling of processes that involve more than just biochemical signaling. Once cells or tissues are not just anymore the \"physical supports\" of biochemical reactions, but are themselves moving, growing or changing their shape, they are subject to universal physical laws. Depending on the situation and the degree of complexity of the model, biological objects can be modeled as rigid solids, fluids, or deformable (elastic/nonelastic) solids. These 3 situations are summarized in sections 2, 3 and 4 of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-deformable solids can have 2 types of motion: an overall motion of their center of mass, and a rotational motion around the center of mass (that leads the position of the center of mass unaffected). Real dynamics often involve complex motion patterns, but patterns can always be decomposed as a sum of center of mass motion + rotations. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Motion of the center of mass\n",
    "The motion of the center of mass of an object A is governed by the second Newton law:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}(M*\\vec V_A) = \\Large\\Sigma \\vec F_{all->A} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $M$ is the total mass, $V_A$ is the velocity of the center of mass, and $\\Large\\Sigma \\vec F_{all->A}$ is the sum of all forces acting on the object. \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, if there is no net total force acting on an object, the motion will continue indefinitely along a straight line with constant velocity. If the object is immobile, it will remain immobile. And if you want to initiate an overall motion, you have to apply a net force. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rotational motion\n",
    "But having a null net force does not mean no force at all is applied on the object. You could apply a force at one point of the object, and an opposite force at another point. The net force is 0 and the center of mass won't move. And, if the forces exerted are along the line joining the two points where they are exerted, nothing will happen. Think about a Hockey puck you would equally press on two diametrally opposed points. However, if now those opposite forces are exerted with some angle relative to the puck diameter joining the two points, then the puck will spin. You have exerted what is called a <b> Torque </b>, denoted $\\tau$. Specifically, you are applying a torque along the direction which is orthogonal to both the direction of the force, and the line joining the two points. This is the rotational equivalent of the net force for overall motions, and it obeys a very similar equation: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{dt}(I*\\vec\\Omega_A) = \\Large\\Sigma \\vec \\tau_{all->A},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\vec\\Omega_A$ represent the angular velocity vector (rotations with respect to x, y and z axes), $I$ is called the <b>  moment of inertia </b> and accounts for how the mass of the solid is distributed with respect to the axes, and as above $\\Large\\Sigma \\vec \\tau_{all->A}$ is the total net torque acting on the solid A. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Action-reaction principle\n",
    "Forces between object are a consequence of microscopic <b> interactions. </b>. As a consequence, is we write or say that an object A exerts a force $\\vec F_{A->B}$ on an object B, then we implicitly write or say that the object B exerts an opposite force, because the \"direction\" of the interaction is a matter of point of view:  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec F_{B->A}= -\\vec F_{A->B}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Both cannot be dissociated, if $\\vec F_{A->B}$ exists, $\\vec F_{B->A}$ exists as well and is opposite. However, generally we are interested in the dynamics of A, or of B, so we only use one of the two forces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example of some common forces in biomechanics\n",
    "Friction (resists motion of two object relative to each other; solid friction, fluid friction or viscous force, lubricated friction... etc); Adhesion forces, like cell-cell junctions, originate in actin-supported transmembrane protein anchoring to a support or another cell);  Traction forces, have many origins including retrograde actin flow in crawling cells; Tensile/compression forces generated by myosin motion along cytoskeleton fibers; Elastic forces, that oppose the deformation of an object...\n",
    "\n",
    "Cells generate forces using their cytoskeleton and other molecular tools, hence they use biochemistry. In return, external force sensing by cells is also based on biochemistry. How the different forces mentioned above are mathematically linked to the biochemical signals defines a biomechanical model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Fluid dynamics and the Navier-Stokes equations \n",
    "The mechanical laws given above apply to non-deformable solids. Similar laws apply to the mechanics of deformable materials. The most deformable materials are fluids, which immediately flow (and thus, irreversibly deform) when a stress is exerted on them. They immediately dissipate the mechanical energy due to the stress. Less deformable are the deformable solids (see 4.), which have the ability to reversibly deform (elastic deformation), and then regain their original shape. We say that elastic solids have the ability to transiently store the mechanical emergy of the stress. Under physiologically relevant timescales cells are intrinsically viscoelastic, meaning they display a combination of both elastic and viscous reponses to mechanical stress. So it is good to know a bit about the equations that govern the dynamics of (viscous) fluids (section 3 here), and the equations that govern elastic deformations (section 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with (viscous) fluids. Their dynamics are governed by the Navier Stokes equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\vec u}{\\partial t}+ \\rho (\\vec u. \\vec \\nabla) \\vec u = - \\vec \\nabla P + \\vec \\nabla . T + \\vec f $$\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems complicated... It is not. $\\rho$ is the volumetric mass, $\\vec u$ the velocity field (see below), $P$ the pressure field, and $T$ the stress tensor that characterizes the mechanical properties of the fluid (see below). \n",
    "\n",
    "It is the equivalent of the second Newton law, but adapted to fluids. The velocity of a fluid does not make any sense: think about a river flow, where should we measure the velocity? The answer is: everywhere. For fluids, we do not talk of a unique velocity, but of a \"velocity field\", which is no more no less than the water flow vector (direction+intensity) at any point within the fluid. Idem for the pressure, which is a defined \"locally\" at any point within the fluid. \n",
    "\n",
    "And because we're talking of a <b> local </b> velocity (field), rather than being weighted by the entire fluid mass like in Newton's law, it is weighted by the volumetric mass $\\rho$, i.e. the mass per unit volume of fluid. So we understand that $\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\vec u}{\\partial t}$ is the equivalent of $M \\frac{d V_A}{dt}$. So what about the second term on the left hand side? \n",
    "\n",
    "We have to take a step back and remember the balance equations. To establish a balance equation on a variable Y, we list sources of the rate of change of Y at time t, and write Y(t+dt)=Y(t)+dt*Rate_of_change_of_Y. What if Y also depends on space, e.g. the coordinate x? Then the equation takes a form of Y(t+dt,x)=Y(t,x)+dt*Rate_of_change_of_Y(x)+dx*Y_flux_from_x-dx - dx*Y_flux_to_x+dx. But now what happens if, in our system, there is an <b> intrinsic flow </b> that transports small sections of the system further away along the x axis with a velocity $u_x$ ? Then it does not make sense to compare Y(t+dt,x) with Y(t,x) because the in the meantime, the initial position x in our system has been transported to a new location $x+u_x*dt$, so when calculating the balance on Y, we should compare $Y(t+dt,x+u_x*dt)$ with $Y(t,x)$. Because we don't like implementing 2 small changes at the same time (i.e., a small time shift dt and a space shift), we compensate exactly for the effect of the internal flow on \"displacing\" system elements by adding this second term. Thinking in more mathematical way, if we have to derivate overtime a function $Y(t,x)$ where $x(t)$ also depends on time (which is the case in presence of the flow), then $dY/dt=\\partial Y / \\partial t + \\partial x/ \\partial t * \\partial Y / \\partial x$. \n",
    "\n",
    "In 3 dimensions, where the velocity field has components along the y and z axis as well, it becomes $$ \\frac{\\partial Y}{\\partial t}+  (\\vec u. \\vec \\nabla) Y$$. This is called the <b> material derivative </b>. This expression for the time derivative of any function of space and time $Y(t,x,y,z)$ needs always to be used when there is a flow. In particular, we need to take this into account when modeling cellular actin density, and related biochemistry, in the presence of a retrograde flow. In it a very common situation in biology. And in the context of the Navier Stokes equation, the variable $Y$ we are interested in is ... the velocity vector $\\vec u$ itself. Hence the left hand side of the NS equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about the right hand side? As in Newton's formula, it contains the forces. Because the equation is written locally, since the velocity field is different everywhere, the right hand side includes the local pressure gradient (analogous to Fick's law, a pressure gradient generates material motion to \"equilibrate\" pressures), the local force field $\\vec f$ if any (including, for instance, gravity, electromagnetic forces if the fluid has electromagnetic properties... anything that acts \"remotely\" on the local fluid elements), and finally the divergence of the stress tensor $\\vec \\nabla T$ that represents the local forces that are due to elements of the fluid acting on their neighbor. \n",
    "\n",
    "The stress tensor contains all the information on the mechanical properties of our system, and how it dissipates emergy. Typically, in biological problems, the stress tensor accounts for shear stresses (fluid analogous of torques for solids), and fluid viscosity (the viscous force being due to the friction of neighboring layers of fluids when you want to move on piece of fluid further...). If you drag your finger through a liquid, your finger will pull some liquid due to viscosity, and this might also cause some turbulence in the fluid due to shear stresses. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the fluid is incompressible, or nearly, which is the case of water and dilute acqueous solutions, or even lipids that make cell membranes, in physiological temperature and pressure conditions, the stress tensor simplifies and the Navier Stokes equation becomes: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\rho \\frac{\\partial \\vec u}{\\partial t}+ \\rho (\\vec u. \\vec \\nabla) \\vec u = - \\vec \\nabla P + \\vec f + \\mu \\Delta \\vec u ,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the $\\Delta$ operator sums up all second derivatives relative to spatial coordinates (see diffusion equation above). The constant coefficient $\\mu$ is called viscosity, and determines how much force is locally generated by a flux of material at the velocity $\\vec u$. Similarly, the viscosity defines the rate at which a fluid can flow under a given external stress ($\\vec f$ and $-\\vec\\nabla P$).\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in short, without solving the full (or the reduced) Navier Stokes equation, in a viscous fluid the local stress is proportional to the gradient of the velocity, i.e. to the <b> rate of strain </b>, the proportionality constant being the viscosity:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = \\mu * \\frac{d \\epsilon}{dt} $$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is why the divergence of the stress tensor produces the term $ \\mu \\Delta \\vec u $ in the full equation, And this is what we will remember here. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. In between solids and liquids: notion of elasticity in biology\n",
    "\n",
    "While fluid dynamics theories based on Navier Stokes-like equations might prove efficient to model what happens in the cytosol, or within organells which are essentially  aqueous media, such theories become insufficient to explain cellular properties where the cell, or part of it (like a rigid organelle, the plasma membrane...etc) opposes a resistance to the deformation. In this situation, an approach accounting for the elastic properties of the cell or its components is required. \n",
    "\n",
    "What are the physics equations governing elasticity ?\n",
    "\n",
    "When a spring is stretched from its equilibrium by an extra length $\\Delta l$, there is a restoring force actin on whatever is stretching the spring, that opposes the direction of the stretch and has an amplitude of $k*\\Delta l$ where $k$ is called the spring constant and depends on what the spring is made of and how it's made. If we stop applying the force, the spring will oscillate back to its initial size. This is called an elastic deformation. If we pull too much, we might irreversibly deform the spring: we have been outside of the \"elastic response\" range of the material. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, for any deformable material there is a range of \"strain\" $\\epsilon$ (i.e., transcient deformation) in which the stress $\\sigma$ (force) produced by the solid to recover its initial shape is linearly proportional to the strain. The constant $E$ is called the Young modulus and we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sigma = E*\\epsilon $$. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the strain is applied along one axis, there is also a resulting deformation along the transverse axis that results from the microscopic interactions that hold the solid together, and this transverse strain is also proportional to the initial strain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\epsilon_{transv.} = - \\epsilon / \\nu $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\nu$ is called the Poisson ratio and the minus sign stands there because if you try to elongate the solid along one direction, it will naturally respond by \"compressing\" along the transverse direction to minimize volume changes. You have experienced this a thousand times in your everyday life. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because both the transverse strain and the stress that follow a given strain are both proportional to the initial strain, we talk of <b> linear elasticity theory </b>. \n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful when modeling biochemical systems? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Viscous and elastic at the same time: the viscoelastic cellular medium\n",
    "The interior of the cell is a very complex medium where elastic organelles and the visco-elastic cytoskeleton are immersed in a viscous fluid and wrapped in viscous fluid-like membranes. \n",
    "Hence, the local stress tensor $\\sigma$ has components both proportional to the strain tensor, and to the rate of strain tensor (see above). \n",
    "\n",
    "In this view, the cellular medium can be modeled as a assembly of springs and dashpots representing respectively the elastic components and the viscous components. How springs and dashpots are combined will produce different force/velocity (or stress/strain) relationships, that will need to be compared with experiments. \n",
