And even when we can't like here, such a relationship can be analyzed in a more straightforward way than the initial ODE system, to find the asymptotics, infer how the different parameters affect the solution ... And also, computational solving of this final algebraic equation is much faster, robust and overall more reliable than solving the ODE system computationally from the beginning.")
