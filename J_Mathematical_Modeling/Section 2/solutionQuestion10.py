print("No, we could do this in a stochastic model. But if we want to write a continuous model, we have to assume that the system is homogeneous at the microscopic scale. In other words, rather than writing equations for the growth and shrinkage of every microtubule which would be conceptually equivalent to write the equations of motion for each molecule in a solution, we define a local density of microtubules, that will be treated as a continuous variable.
