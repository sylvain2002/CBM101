print("No. An hydrodynamic current in space drags molecules with its velocity. The velocity v is a change in position per unit time. Hence, position(t+dt)=position(t)+V*dt. A growth rate g is a change in volume per unit time. Hence, volume(t+dt)=volume(t)+g*dt. Because, in this example, our second variable (in addition to time) is a volume, not a space component, the corresponding convection is the growth rate. We're stopping here the analogy, if you find it funny that's great! If you don't that's ok as well. You don't need to understand that.")
