print("The FP approximation formula sums over the elementary reactions mu=1..M (M total number of reactions), and for each reaction we sum over the number N of stochastic variables. But because not all variables are modified by the reaction, for any reaction there is only a finite number of coefficients delta_mu,i which are different of 0, the ones that correspond to the molecular species i involved in the reaction. For synthesis/degradation reactions, only one coefficient will be different from 0, for conversion reactions that convert one species into another, 2 coefficients. For reactions that convert 2 species into a third one like the formation of a bimolecular complex, 3 coefficients will be different from 0, the ones with index i corresponding to the two interactors and to the complex. So, in general, these sums from i=1 to N in the general FP formula reduce to 1-2-3 terms. For the second order part, because there are two sums, we can have 4-9 terms. ")
