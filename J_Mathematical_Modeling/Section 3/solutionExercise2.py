All the transitions between states with m,n and m+-1,n+-1 accounted for in the previous model where the promoter is always on are still possible irrespective of the state of the promoter, with one exception though: the mRNA synthesis reaction (terms with rate nu_0) is not possible when the promoter is off. Those reactions do not change the state of the promoter: so they are transitions between states (m,n,p) and (m',n',p') only with p'=p. In addition, there are now elementary reactions that activate , and inactivate the promoter, with respective rates k_on and k_off. Those reactions involve the states (m,n,p) and (m'=m,n'=n,p') where p' is not equal to p.")
